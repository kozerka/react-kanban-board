## Application State Management

This application uses React's Context API to handle the global state. It ensures seamless data flow and state access throughout the components. The app's core state comprises tasks, columns, and users, among other data points.

### Using Local Storage

Data persistence is a crucial feature, especially for task management tools. This application uses the browser's `localStorage` to ensure that your task data doesn't vanish after closing the browser. The app seamlessly integrates `localStorage` to fetch, update, and delete tasks and other related data, giving a smooth user experience.

### Error Handling with Context and Modals

Application displays errors using modals, powered by a dedicated ErrorContext. This context ensures immediate and clear feedback to users, centralizing error management and providing a consistent user experience. Leveraging this approach simplifies real-time error handling across all components.
